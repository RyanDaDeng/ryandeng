## More...
This is a project that helps me learn a lot vuejs and my first startup project.

The project is built on March 2017 and rushed draft version in 2 weeks. The project is not fully polished and is not following good OOD design, it requires more clean-up.

The backend structure is shit....

There are many useless files and haven't been cleaned up, they are all my testing files...
